# QuickSort Algorithm

## Description
This project implements the QuickSort algorithm, a highly efficient sorting technique based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It sorts sequences using iterators and supports generic data types.

## Key Features
- **Generic Implementation**: Compatible with any data type that extends `Comparable`.
- **Iterator-Based Sorting**: Operates directly on iterators for versatile data manipulation.
- **Randomized Pivot**: Uses random pivot selection for improved average-case performance.
- **Recursive Design**: Implements the QuickSort algorithm recursively for optimal clarity.
- **Partitioning Logic**: Efficiently partitions sequences around the pivot element.
