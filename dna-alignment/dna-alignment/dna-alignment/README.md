# DNA Sequencing Project

## Description
This project implements a DNA sequence alignment tool that uses dynamic programming to find the optimal alignment between two DNA strands. It minimizes gaps and mismatches, a fundamental concept in bioinformatics for tasks like genome comparison and evolutionary studies.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Programming**: Efficient computation of optimal alignment scores.
- **Alignment Visualization**: Displays matches (`|`), mismatches (`:`), and gaps (`.`) for clear interpretation.
- **Customizable Scoring**: Supports adjustable scores for matches, mismatches, and gaps.
- **Random DNA Generation**: Generates random DNA sequences for testing and experimentation.

This project demonstrates problem-solving and algorithm design skills while exploring a key bioinformatics application.
