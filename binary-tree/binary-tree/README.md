# Binary Tree Project

## Description
This project implements a binary tree data structure in Java, complete with custom iterators for forward and reverse traversal. The binary tree is designed to efficiently manage and traverse hierarchical data using both in-order and reverse in-order traversal.

## Features
- **Node-based structure**: Each tree node contains data, left and right child references, and a parent reference.
- **Custom Iterators**:
    - **Forward Iterator**: Allows in-order traversal of the tree from the smallest to the largest element.
    - **Reverse Iterator**: Supports reverse in-order traversal from the largest to the smallest element.
- **Tree Construction**:
    - Build a tree from an array in in-order layout.
    - Supports manual tree construction by connecting nodes.
- **Traversal Utilities**:
    - Access the first or last node in the tree.
    - Retrieve the next or previous node in in-order traversal.
- **Additional Features**:
    - Tree cloning.
    - Equality checks for tree structure and contents.
    - Utility functions for node access and manipulation.
