# Vending Machine Simulation

## Description
This Vending Machine simulation models the core functionalities of a real-world vending machine using Java. It includes user interactions, coin handling, and inventory management. The system allows users to add coins, select products, and retrieve change. Administrators can manage inventory and oversee machine operations.

## Key Features
- **User Interaction**: Users can insert coins, select items, and retrieve change.
- **Coin Management**: Handles various denominations (Nickels, Dimes, Quarters).
- **Inventory Management**: Tracks available items in the vending machine.
- **Administrator Access**: Enables inventory updates and machine configurations.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create a modular and maintainable structure.

## Classes Overview
- **User**: Represents a customer interacting with the machine.
- **Admin**: Provides management capabilities for inventory and machine settings.
- **VendingMachine**: Core functionality for handling transactions and inventory.
- **Coins**: Represents monetary values with subclasses for different denominations.
- **Items**: Represents products available in the vending machine.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing more robust error handling for invalid user actions.
- Adding functionality to calculate and return exact change.
- Enhancing the GUI for better user experience.
